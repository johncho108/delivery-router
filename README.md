This program, created for an undergraduate course, implements a chaining hash table, an undirected graph (adjacency list), and a variation of a nearest neighbors algorithm in order to find efficient routes for truck deliveries based on a map of Salt Lake City (csv with distances between all cities) and delivery constraints (e.g. delivery deadlines, package groupings, etc.).

Thanks for stopping by!
